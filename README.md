this repositery covers our second applied learning in the computer science course
this ALT is based on statistics and organizing them in a clear way and removing an unnecessary information that is not needed and simplifying the information(this is called abstraction)
in this ALT we are taking thousands of figures on earthquakes (on things such as magnitude, latitude and date of the earthquake) and condensing into simple results table so that anybody can easily understand it
